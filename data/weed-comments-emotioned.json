Years ago doctors prescribed Ritalin and other drugs to children and are just discovering now that children's brains are not just little adult brains. They are developing and substances that hinder that development can cause life-long problems. Make no mistake about it. Teens are children.

    "body": "What a crock of crap. No glasses can make a person feel stoned. This is just another line of Bull crap by those that have not tried marijuana ,but pretend to have an informed opinion or the subject. Marijuana does not cause  \"the distorted processing of visual information, loss of motor coordination, and slowed decision-making and reaction time resulting from recreational marijuana use.\"  I will agree that  slowed decision-making and reaction time will occur when you first start using marijuana. Then as time goes by you lose that effect as your body has gotten used to operating under those conditions and has adapted. Same as someone moving from the North to the South to live. the heat is almost unbearable, until their body adapts to the heat. Driving under the influence of marijuana for a consistent user of marijuana is nowhere like driving under the influence of alcohol. You do not weave in and out of traffic. You do tend to drive slower. And you have to make an effort to concentrate on the road and not your friends or the music or any other distractions.",

Children should be taught CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS   not how to further ignorance and sheeplike mentality.   Instead of arming children with the ability to think for themselves and see bullshit for bullshit,  the push crap like this into schools.  These goggles only make students want to try MJ even more.  How disappointed they will be when it doesn't do any of the cool effects the goggles did???   They will have to move on to harder drugs to find the desired buzz.   Cannabis isn't a gateway drug,  but those goggles sure as hell are.    Shame on you for trying to fill childrens heads with pure nonsense.   Stay away from my kids with shit like this or I will come find you!\\n",
